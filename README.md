wobblui
=======

*This project is experimental / unfinished!*

Wobblui is a simple, self-contained UI framework for Python 3 that is
cross-platform!

**Features**:

- *Cross-platform:* Works on Windows, Linux, and [Android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android)
- *Consistent:* looks the same on all supported platforms
- *Self-contained:* no dependency on other libraries outside of `PySDL2` and `PIL`, and all code is pure python
- *Efficient:* uses lazy redraw and lazy relayouting to avoid battery drain during idle
- *Customizable:* easy support for custom widgets and simple styling
- *Versatile:* proper richtext support with HTML parser to set formatting

Installation
------------

To use wobblui, install the `SDL2`, `SDL2_Image` and `SDL2_TTF` C
libraries, and fetch the latest version of wobblui using pip:

```
pip install --user -U wobblui
```
