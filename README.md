# wobblui - a python UI

This is a simple, self-contained UI framework for Python that uses
`PySDL2` and `PIL` (python image library). It should work for any
of the platforms where those two libraries are available.

Cool stuff:

- tested with `python-for-android`
- easy to add custom widgets
- proper redraw handling to avoid battery drain
